This C++ program is designed to implement a digital clock. It consists of a class Digital_Clock, which represents the clock. The class has methods to initialize the time, perform the logic to update the time, and display the time. The time is represented in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.

The logic() method iterates over the hours, minutes, and seconds using nested loops, updating the time and displaying it on the console. The display() method simply prints the current time.

The program takes user input for the initial time in the format "HH MM SS" (hours, minutes, seconds) and checks whether the input time is valid using the chekout() function. If the input time is valid, an instance of the Digital_Clock class is created with the provided time, and its logic() and display() methods are called to run the clock.

The AMPM() function is used to display "AM" or "PM" based on the hour.

However, there are several issues with this implementation:

It does not accurately represent the current time. Instead, it iterates over all possible times within a day, resulting in unnecessary computations.
The use of system("cls") to clear the screen is not portable and may not work on all systems.
There is no mechanism to continuously update the displayed time to reflect the current time. Instead, it displays all times within a day in rapid succession.
Error handling for invalid input is limited, and the program simply exits if the input time format is incorrect.
Overall, while the program attempts to simulate a digital clock, it lacks key functionalities and has implementation issues that need to be addressed for it to function correctly.
